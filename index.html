        <h2>About the Quran</h2>
        <p>The Quran, also spelled as Qur'an, is the holy book of Islam. It is believed to be the word of God as dictated to Muhammad by the archangel Gabriel. The Quran is composed of 114 chapters, known as Surahs, which cover various aspects of life, guidance for personal conduct, and the relationship between God and humans.</p>
        <p>The Quran was revealed over a period of approximately 23 years, beginning in 610 CE, when Muhammad was 40, and concluding in 632 CE, the year of his death. The Quran is written in classical Arabic and is regarded as the finest piece of literature in the Arabic language.</p>
        <p>The preservation of the Quran in its original form has been a significant focus for Muslims throughout history. Early copies of the Quran were meticulously memorized and transcribed by the Prophet Muhammad's companions, ensuring that the text remained unchanged over the centuries.</p>
